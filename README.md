This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Challenge 15 - “Jingle All The Way”

Every year on the 24th December, Santa faces the busiest evening of the year as he sets out on a mission to deliver gifts to every corner of the world. Obviously, Santa visits every household in every country, but a slightly more compressed itinerary of his route has been provided along with his expected time of arrival in each location (in GMT). Your task is to write an algorithm capable of returning the time remaining until his next destination at any given time during the evening. The use of time/date libraries is allowed.

## Rewards:

- three: Points are awarded for a working algorithm
- two: Further points are awarded for providing a suitable set of unit tests
- five: Further points are awarded for displaying a map of Santa's route, along with his current approximate location for any given time during the evening

Example:
Given an input time of Sun Dec 25 2022 02:20:00 GMT+0000, a simple algorithm might return:
Arriving in Reykjavík in 10 minutes
